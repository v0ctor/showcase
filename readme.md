# VÃ­ctor's showcase

## About

This is the repository of my showcase, where I share my professional career, my skills and my interests. Find it live [here](https://victordiaz.me).

### Standards

The project follows these standards:

* [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/): coding style.
* [PSR-4](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/): autoloading.
* [PHPDoc](https://docs.phpdoc.org/references/phpdoc/index.html): documentation.

Extended by the following rules:

* Code must sort `use` declarations in alphabetical order.
* Code must use the short array declaration style.
* Code must align multiline constant declarations and array key-value pairs.
* Code must use a comma after last element in multiline arrays.

### Directory structure

The project follows the [default Laravel application structure](https://laravel.com/docs/structure) with the following addition:

* `docker`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml` and `.dockerignore` define the Docker environments.
* `kubernetes` contains all necessary [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) manifests to deploy the application.

## First steps

The project comes with a fully functional [Docker](https://www.docker.com) environment that has everything necessary to develop on any platform.

### Installation

The only software requirements are [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) (Community Edition) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). Follow the previous links to read the installation instructions. It is necessary to install the latest versions before continuing.

#### Environment file

Once installed, copy the example environment file to its default location.

```Shell
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, complete the `UID` environment variable with your user ID (`id -u`). Thus, the application container will use your user to interact with shared volumes.

```Shell
sed -i "s/UID=.*/UID=$(id -u)/" .env
```

#### Docker environment

The development environment is made of two different containers:

* `app` runs the application itself using the [PHP interpreter](https://php.net).
* `web` serves the application through HTTP using [Nginx](https://nginx.org).

To build the environment for the very first time, run Docker Compose in daemon mode. It may take a few minutes.

```Shell
docker-compose up -d
```

Then, enter to the `app` container.

```Shell
docker-compose exec -u $(id -u) app bash
```

To easily access the container on subsequent occasions, you can add the following alias to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file.

```Shell
alias app="docker-compose exec -u $(id -u) app bash"
```

### Initialization

Being inside of the `app` container for the first time, you should install the dependencies.

```Shell
composer install
npm install
```

### Usage

Now you can use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org), [Artisan](https://laravel.com/docs/artisan) and [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de) inside the container, among others. [Xdebug](https://xdebug.org) is also available from the host machine.

To use the application through HTTP, you can perform requests to [http://localhost](http://localhost).

The database is also accessible from the host with the following credentials:

* **Host:** `localhost`
* **Port:** `3306`
* **Database:** `test`
* **Username:** `test`
* **Password:** `test`

> Note that Git is not available in the container, so you should use it from the host machine.

### Deployment

The deployment process is automated with [Drone](https://drone.io) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io). When changes are incorporated into production (`master` branch) or staging (`develop` branch), an automatic deployment is made to the corresponding environment.

## Problem resolution

There are several common problems that can be easily solved. Here are their causes and solutions.

### Composer

When a class is not found, check that it is in the correct namespace. If that was not the problem, you should [update the autoloader](https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#dump-autoload-dumpautoload-) by running the following command.

```Shell
composer dump-autoload
```

### Docker

The Docker environment should work properly as it has been exhaustively tested. Otherwise, it is always possible to rebuild it. To start from scratch, you can remove all containers, images and volumes by running the following commands.

> Note that all system containers, images and volumes will be deleted, not only those related to this project.

```Shell
docker-compose down
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
docker rmi $(docker images -q)
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -f dangling=true -q)
```
