## First steps

The project comes with a fully functional [Docker](https://www.docker.com) environment that has everything necessary to develop on any platform.

### Installation

The only software requirements are [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) (Community Edition) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). Follow the previous links to read the installation instructions. It is necessary to install the latest versions before continuing.

#### Environment file

Once installed, copy the example environment file to its default location.

```Shell
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, complete `USER_ID` and `USER_NAME` environment variables with your user ID (`id -u`) and your username (`whoami`). Thus, Docker containers will work with the same user than your computer.

#### Docker environment

The development environment is made of two different containers:

* `app` runs the application itself using the [PHP interpreter](https://php.net).
* `web` serves the application through HTTP using [Nginx](https://nginx.org).

To build the environment for the very first time, run Docker Compose in daemon mode. It may take a few minutes.

```Shell
docker-compose up -d
```

Then, enter to the `app` container.

```Shell
docker exec -it -u=$(id -u) app bash
```

### Initialization

Being inside of the `app` container for the first time, you should install the dependencies.

```Shell
composer install
```

### Usage

Now you can use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org), [Artisan](https://laravel.com/docs/artisan) and [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de) inside the container, among others. [Xdebug](https://xdebug.org) is also available from the host machine.

To use the application through HTTP, you can perform requests to [http://localhost](http://localhost).
